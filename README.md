### About Workflow
Workflow is the all-in-one open-source and free productivity app for everyone. Whether you're a student, a developer, or simply someone wanting to be more organized in their life, then you've come to the right app. Workflow is built for everything, including projects, development, tasks, studies, business, general use, and more.

Built by a student with ADHD (hello!) this app is made to get you in the zone, making work effortless and maybe even fun. Focus features include a customizable pomodoro timer, focus screen, task tracking, and even a rewards system to keep you motivated to achieve more.

Workflow can handle small everyday tasks or full large-scale projects, housing each project in it's own customizable workspace, with planned widget support that works like your own custom personal feed for work.

The app is open-source, community-driven and built on **WinUI 3** (.NET 9.0)

### Want to contribute on the code?
The app is not yet ready to be launched as an open-source repository, because it's still in very early development. However if you want to contribute to the development repository, suggest changes, write code, or just have a look around out of curiosity, please submit this form to get access to the private development repository:
